{"name":"Prime Framework","tagline":"Prime Framework public site","body":"# Prime Framework\r\nPrime Framework is a collection of projects that assist in building web applications (in Java and/or JavaScript). Each sub-project has its own website that contains a brief overview and usage for that project. Here's the list:\r\n\r\n* [Prime JS](http://prime-framework.github.io/prime-js/)\r\n\r\nA core principle of Prime is that we love documentation INSIDE code. Therefore, our online documentation will be sparse. We encourage you to download the source code and use it as a starting point for Prime. However, some projects do require a bit more than reading documentation. For these projects, refer to the example on the website or any examples inside the repository itself.\r\n\r\n## Issues\r\n\r\nPlease log issues using the Github issue tracking system. Be sure to log issues to the correct project.\r\n\r\n## Mailing lists\r\n\r\nPrime framework maintains a single email list for all projects. The email list is a Google group and you can join it here:\r\n\r\n[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prime-framework-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/prime-framework-users)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
